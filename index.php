                          <div>
                          <i>Ecoself</i> is a reimagined Indigenous concept; understanding and expressing our <i>ecoself</i> restores our wellbeing. Our <i>ecoself</i> is who we are as individuals and communities in the context of our own natures, abilities, and experiences, our genetics, our ancestral <i><strong class="fontbold"><a target="_blank" href="#definitions">ecological webs (ecowebs)</a></i></strong>, and &#x2014; for migrants &#x2014; our adopted ecowebs. When we are unrooted in our <i>ecoself</i>, we misperceive ourselves as being separate from each other and our <i>ecowebs</i>, leading us to engage in behaviors that cause ecocide (resulting in <a target="_blank" href="#definitions">biodiversity</a> loss, climate crisis) and inequity(injustice, poverty, disenfranchisement, identity loss, hunger, violence). But when we become aware of our <i>ecoself</i>, we anchor ourselves in the Great Web of nature and humanity and are able to live in <a target="_blank" href="#definitions">symbiosis</a> with both. <a target="_blank" href="https://ecosymbiont.org/earth/content/systems/ecoweb-rooted-framing/ecoself-restoring-our-wellbeing-rooted-in-nature-and-humanity">Link to full article here</a>.

                          <div>
                          Exploiting, without replenishing, human and ecological resources (extractivism) by profit-making <a target="_blank" href="#definitions">corporations</a> is a modern (400+ years) form of imperialism that is enabled by a global system of extractivist education, technologies, laws, trade edicts, and governance structures imposed on nearly all peoples. This system disconnects humans from ecowebs and causes widespread ecocide and inequity. Thus, it must be disrupted and replaced in its entirety if ecowebs (humans included) are to survive. The collaborative conceptualizing and implementing of locally-rooted (regenerative) systems that optimize ecoweb wellbeing are essential to transition away from the globally institutionalized extractivist system.

                                <strong>Systems Transformation</strong>. Our systems transformation work focuses on transforming man-made extractivist systems (<i>e.g.</i>,  economics-law-governance-education (ELGE) systems) causing widespread ecocide and inequity worldwide.

Our <i>ReRoot</i> campaigns aim to inspire human beings from all walks of life, everywhere in the world, to understand and express their individual and community <i>ecoself</i>. We invite anyone with passion to co-create art, music, and/or performance pieces that encourage people to (a) unlearn, <i>i.e.</i>, to peel away the layers of, inhibition and untruths that may be burdening them with perspectives and beliefs that lead to self-deprecation and/or ecocidal/inequitable behaviors; and (b) relearn how to understand and express their <i>ecoselves</i>. <a target="_blank" href="https://ecosymbiont.org/earth/content/action/activism/reroot-campaigns-for-ecoself-rooted-public-unlearning-and-relearning">Link to full article here</a>.

                                extractivism. This suffering takes the form of food insecurity, oppression, violence,

                            <p>Systemic extractivism has caused human communities to be disconnected from the biodiverse
                                ancestral ecowebs they preserved for thousands of years through sophisticated
                                regenerative knowledge, technologies, and practices. This disconnection &#x2014; resulting from
                                forced human displacement and ecoweb destruction &#x2014; has in turn devastated the
                                self-sufficiency, self-reliance, identity, and culture of communities and compelled them
