                                ecological webs (<span>ecowebs</span>) and to <span>regenerate</span> systems that
                                restore, preserve, and foster our mutually beneficial interconnectivity and

                            <p>We focus on regenerating systems that advance food sovereignty, sustainable healthcare,
                                and ecoweb integration rooted in human communities. These systems are of two types:</p>

                                <li><strong><i>human activity systems:</i></strong> ecoweb-specific systems of
                                    knowledge, technologies, and practices developed by ecoweb-rooted human communities
                                    – such as Indigenous and tribal communities – that are based and rely on the
                                    specific and preserved biodiversity of each ecoweb; and</li>
                                <li><strong><i>legal-economic-governance systems:</i></strong> operating locally,
                                    regionally, and globally and that optimize the wellbeing of human communities and
                                    the ecowebs of which they are a symbiotic part.</li>

                            <p>Our approach to fulfilling our mission is two-fold:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong><i>Disrupt and reshape:</i></strong> We work to disrupt and reshape the
                                    globally institutionalized legal-economic-governance system that has been destroying
                                    human-ecoweb symbiosis by fiercely promoting corporate
                                    <span><u>extractivism</u></span> (exploitation of human and non-human ecoweb
                                    resources without replenishment). This work is done through legal action, policy
                                    reform, and other methods.
                                </li>
                                <li><strong><i>Facilitate synergies:</i> </strong>We bring together and facilitate
                                    <span><u>synergies</u></span> between <span><u>grassroots</u></span> changemakers,
                                    innovators, and knowledge-holders working to regenerate systems that restore,
                                    preserve, and foster human-ecoweb symbiosis. We do this through in-person
                                    <strong>Synergy Meetings</strong> and through our online knowledge-sharing and
                                    community-building platform, <strong>Ecosymbionts Regenerate Together.</strong>

                            <p>Billions of human beings across the world are suffering as a result of ever-increasing
                                extractivism. This suffering takes the form of food insecurity, oppression, violence,
                                impoverishment, climate crisis, inequitable access to resources, water scarcity, forced
                                displacement, loss of identity and culture, disenfranchisement, and environmental
                                degradation. Unless there is a fundamental change in the systems enabling this
                                extractivism, both we humans and the biodiverse ecowebs we rely on for our survival will
                                be irreversibly injured, and possibly annihilated.</p>

                            <p>Systemic extractivism has caused human communities to be disconnected from the biodiverse
                                ancestral ecowebs they preserved for thousands of years through sophisticated
                                regenerative knowledge, technologies, and practices. This disconnection – resulting from
                                forced human displacement and ecoweb destruction – has in turn devastated the
                                self-sufficiency, self-reliance, identity, and culture of communities and compelled them
                                to become increasingly dependent on corporate commodities and influence, thus
                                perpetuating and deepening the cycle of extractivism and suffering. The only way to end
                                this cycle is to restore human-ecoweb symbiosis through the regeneration – by
                                Indigenous, tribal, and migrant/settler communities alike – of systems that nurture and
                                sustain, rather than extract and eradicate. </p>
