                                    reform, and other methods.

                            <p>Billions of human beings across the world are suffering as a result of ever-increasing
                                extractivism. This suffering takes the form of food insecurity, oppression, violence,
                                impoverishment, climate crisis, inequitable access to resources, water scarcity, forced
                                displacement, loss of identity and culture, disenfranchisement, and environmental
                                degradation. Unless there is a fundamental change in the systems enabling and perpetuating this extractivism, both we humans and the biodiverse ecowebs we rely on for our survival will be irreversibly injured, and possibly annihilated.</p>

                                regenerative knowledge, technologies, and practices. This disconnection &#x2014; resulting from
                                forced human displacement and ecoweb destruction &#x2014; has in turn devastated the
