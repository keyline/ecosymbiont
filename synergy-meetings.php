                            corporation-caused disaster, resulting in the deaths and disabling of hundreds of thousands
                            of marginalized people over multiple generations. Here in the San Francisco Bay Area,
                            corporations have been exploiting, polluting, and appropriating land and people for over a
                            century. How can we disrupt this corporation-enriching global extractive system that results
                            in widespread injustice, poverty, hunger, climate change, and irreversible environmental
                            destruction? Join changemakers, knowledge-holders, and innovators from Bhopal and the Bay,
                            representing over 30 organizations and diverse perspectives, as they discuss how frontline/
                            Indigenous communities and activists across the world are taking on what is the greatest
                            challenge of our time. Participants will include organizers, community/ Indigenous leaders,
                            artists, lawyers, activists, musicians, reformers, and other changemakers from a diverse
                            range of ethnicities and perspectives, including waste reduction, carceral reform,
