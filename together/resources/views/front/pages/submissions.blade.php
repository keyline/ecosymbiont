Given the current legal framework associated with copyright and licensing, at least one human individual must be a co-author if an ecoweb-rooted community or movement is an author. Please also see the instructions below:</p>

Examples of ecoweb-rooted communities are: the Idu Mishmi of Arunachal Pradesh (India) and the Lisjan Ohlone of California (United States).</li>

                                                    <li>As you generate your Creative-Work, please keep in mind that readers and grassroots individuals and collectives from across the world will be viewing your Creative-Work if it is published by ERT as content. Thus, please write and present in a manner that explains terms and concepts specific to your region or culture, such that a person completely unfamiliar with the topic and regional/cultural context of your Creative-Work can understand.</li>
                                                    <li>Please write in a simple and clear manner that is not academic, keeping in mind that readers and grassroots individuals and collectives viewing your Creative-Work are from a variety of occupational and cultural backgrounds and are most probably not native English speakers. When citing another’s publication, please simply state the finding and use footnotes to provide information about the full citation. For example, do <strong style="color: #d09c1c;">not</strong> write: “Garcia and Hussain (2018) describe various detrimental neurological effects of environmental pollution in frontline communities.” Instead, write: “Environmental pollution has been reported to have various detrimental neurological effects in frontline communities.<sup>1</sup>” Then in your footnote for (1) provide the entire citation of Garcia and Hussain (2018).</li>
                                                    <li>If you are including citations in your Creative-Work, please format them as follows: M. Garcia, L. Hussain, Environmental Pollution Causes Neurological Effects in Impacted Communities, Journal of Impacts: Vol. 5 (Issue 12), pp. 46-48 (2018). </li>
                                                    <li>ERT encourages the submission of Creative-Works in vernacular languages. For narratives —– both word narratives and descriptive narratives —– please ensure that if the language is not English, you also submit an accurate English translation of the entire narrative. 
                                                        For video in which the languages spoken are not English, please ensure that there are accurate English subtitles within the submitted video.
